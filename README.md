# Higher-order Network Structure Inference

GitHub repository for the paper "Higher-Order Network Structure Inference". 

The code is written in Python and can be found in the folder Code; the functions needed to run the algorithm are in the file functions_for_analysis.ipynb. The algorithm itself can be run in the file example.ipynb (the path to Gurobi optimizer is needed). The data used in the example are currently not available in the repository.
